# Procedural Generated Island

WIP - Investigating procedural generation, trying to implement it as a mesh generator to create islands to use for a procedural generated mobile puzzle game I'm planning to create.


## Roadmap

- [ ] Create mesh out of Gizmos
- [ ] Create some kind of plane edge near every tile
- [ ] Height Map - Procedural Generate mountains
- [ ] Procedural Generate Rivers and Trees
